This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 Compound Words</h3>

<p>In some languages, such as German, it is acceptable to string two words
together, thus forming a compound word.  However, there are rules to
when this can be done.  Furthermore, it is not always sufficient to
simply concatenate the two words.  For example, sometimes a letter is
inserted between the two words.  Aspell currently has support for
unconditionally stringing words together.  I tried implementing more
sophisticated support for compound words in Aspell but it was too
limiting and no one used it.

   <p>After receiving feedback from several people it seems that acceptable
support for compound words involved two basically independent parts. 
If this is not sufficient for your language please let me know.

<h3 class="heading">Part One</h3>

<p>Describes how the word needs to be changed when forming a compound

<pre class="example">     CMP &lt;flag&gt; &lt;strip&gt; &lt;add&gt; &lt;cond&gt; &lt;cond2&gt;
     
     &lt;flag&gt;  is the compound flag
     &lt;strip&gt; is the string to strip or 0 for the null string
     &lt;add&gt;   is the string to add or 0 for the null string
     &lt;cond&gt;  is the condition to match at the end of the current word
     &lt;cond2&gt; is the condition to match at the beginning of the next word
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All but the last field are the same as a suffix entry in the existing
affix code.

   <p>&lt;cond&gt; is a simplified regular expression.  Some examples:
<pre class="example">     . (for anything)
     e
     [^aeiou]y
     [^ey]
     [aeiou]y
</pre>
   <p>It does not seem necessary to change the beginning of a word when
forming compounds

<h3 class="heading">Part Two</h3>

<p>Describes the position a word can appear in (beginning, middle, or
end) and with which words.

   <p>To do this each word can be assigned a category.  Then each category
can be given a set of rules to describe how it can be used in a
compound word for example

<pre class="example">     A + B: indicates that category A may appear at the beginning of a
       word when followed by a category B word.  When combined it is then
       considered a category B word.
     A + C + B: here a C word may only appear between an A or B word
     A + A + B
     A + A
     A + A + A
     etc..
</pre>
   <p>I have not decided if a word should be allowed to belong to more than
one category as a new category can be created in necessary to mean
words in both category A and B for example.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.1.1 To Implement</h4>

<p>To implement support for compound words based on the above description
the following will need to be done:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>expand the affix code to support special compound flags as
described in part one

     <li>write code to store the conditions as described in part two

     <li>expand the compound checking code to check against the conditions

     <li>expand the dictionary format to store the necessary compound info
with the word

        </ol>

   <p>I don't know when I will be able to actually implement this.  If you
would like to try please let me know.
