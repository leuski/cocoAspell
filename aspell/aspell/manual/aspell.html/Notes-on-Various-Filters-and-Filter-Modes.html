<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Notes on Various Filters and Filter Modes</h4>

<p>Aspell now has filter support.  You can either select from individual
filters or choose a filter mode.  To select a filter mode use the
<samp><span class="option">mode</span></samp> option.  You may choose from `<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">url</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">email</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">sgml</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">ccpp</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">tex</span></samp>' and any other
available on your system.  The default mode is `<samp><span class="samp">url</span></samp>'.  Individual
filters can be added with the option <samp><span class="option">add-filter</span></samp> and removed
with the <samp><span class="option">rem-filter</span></samp> option.  The currently available filters
are `<samp><span class="samp">url</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">email</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">sgml</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">tex</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">latex</span></samp>'
(alias for `<samp><span class="samp">tex</span></samp>'), `<samp><span class="samp">nroff</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">context</span></samp>', as well as a
bunch of filters which translate the text from one format to another.

   <p>To check which filters are available use <samp><span class="command">aspell dump filters</span></samp>. 
To check which filter modes are available use <samp><span class="command">aspell dump
modes</span></samp>.  The <samp><span class="command">aspell help</span></samp> command will also list all available
filter and filter modes.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.1 None Filter Mode</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">none</span></samp> mode is exactly what it says.  It turns off all filters.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.2 URL Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">url</span></samp> filter/mode skips over URLs, host names, and email
addresses.  Because this filter is almost always useful and rarely
does any harm it is enabled in all modes except <samp><span class="option">none</span></samp>.  To
turn it off either select the <samp><span class="option">none</span></samp> mode or use
<samp><span class="option">rem-filter</span></samp> option <em>after</em> the desired mode is selected.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.3 Email Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">email</span></samp> filter mode skips over quoted text.  It currently
does not support skipping over headers however a future version
should.  In the meantime I suggest you use Aspell with Newsbody which
can be found at <a href="http://home.worldonline.dk/~byrial/newsbody/">http://home.worldonline.dk/~byrial/newsbody/</a>. 
The option <samp><span class="option">email-skip</span></samp> controls the number of characters that
can appear before the email quote character, the default is 10.  The
option <samp><span class="option">add|rem-email-quote</span></samp> controls the characters that are
considered quote characters, the defaults are `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>'.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.4 SGML Filter</h5>

<p>The SGML filter allows you to spell check SGML, HTML, XHTML, and XML
files. In most cases everything within a tag `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;tag attrib=value
attrib2="a whole sentence"&gt;</span></samp>' will be skipped by the spell checker. The
SGML/HTML/XML that Aspell supports is a slight superset of most DTDs
(Document Type Definitions) and can spell check the often non-conforming
HTML found on the web.

   <p>Two configuration options, <samp><span class="option">sgml-skip</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">sgml-check</span></samp>,
allow you to control what is spell checked. The tag and attribute names
specified are case insensitive.

     <dl>
<dt><b>sgml-skip</b><dd>This is a list of tags whose contents will also be skipped by the spell
checker.  For example, if you wish to leave a misspelling in a document
and not have them flagged as misspellings, you could surround them with
a &lt;nospellcheck&gt; tag:
     <pre class="example">            &lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;NOSPELLCHECK&gt;leviosa&lt;/NOSPELLCHECK&gt;
            is what Mr. Potter said&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">And put that word in the skip config directive:
     <pre class="example">          add-sgml-skip nospellcheck
     </pre>
     <br><dt><b>sgml-check</b><dd>
This is a list of attributes whose values you do want spell checked. By
default, 'alt' (&lt;img&gt; alternate text) is a member of the check list
since it is text that is seen by a web page viewer. You may also want
'value' to be on the check list since that is the text put on buttons:
     <pre class="example">          add-sgml-check value
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">In this case `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;input type=button value="Donr"&gt;</span></samp>' will be flagged as a
misspelling. 
</dl>

   <p>This filter will also translate SGML characters of the form
`<samp><span class="samp">&amp;#num;</span></samp>'.  Other SGML characters such as `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;amp;</span></samp>' will simply
be skipped over so that the word `<samp><span class="samp">amp</span></samp>', for example, will not be
spell checked.  Eventually full support for properly translating SGML
characters will be added.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.5 HTML Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">html</span></samp> filter is like the SGML Filter Mode but specialized for
HTML.  By default, 'script' and 'style' are members of the skip list in
HTML mode.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.6 TeX/LaTeX Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">tex</span></samp> (all lowercase) filter mode skips over TeX
commands and parameters and/or options to certain commands.  It also
skips over TeX comments by default.  The option
<samp><span class="option">[dont-]tex-check-comments</span></samp> controls whether or not Aspell will
skip over TeX comments.  The option <samp><span class="option">add|rem-tex-command</span></samp>
controls which TeX commands should have certain parameters and/or
options also skipped over.  Commands that are not specified will have
all their parameters and/or options checked.  The format for each item
is

<pre class="example">     &lt;command&gt; &lt;a list of p,P,o and Os&gt;
</pre>
   <p>The first item is simply the command name.  The second item controls
which parameters to skip over.  A 'p' skips over a parameter while a
'P' doesn't.  Similarly an 'o' will skip over an optional parameter
while an 'O' doesn't.  The first letter on the list will apply to the
first parameter, the second letter will apply to the second parameter
etc.  If there are more parameters than letters Aspell will simply
check them as normal.  For example the option

<pre class="example">     add-tex-command rule pp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will skip over the first two parameters of the <code>rule</code> command
while the option

<pre class="example">     add-tex-command foo Pop
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will <em>check</em> the first parameter of the <code>foo</code> command, skip
over the next optional parameter, if it is present, and will skip over
the second parameter &mdash; even if the optional parameter is not present
&mdash; and will check any additional parameters.

   <p>A `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' at the end of the command is simply ignored.  For example
the option

<pre class="example">     enlargethispage p
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will ignore the first parameter in both <samp><span class="option">enlargethispage</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">enlargethispage*</span></samp>.

   <p>To remove a command simply use the <samp><span class="option">rem-tex-command</span></samp> option. 
For example

<pre class="example">     rem-tex-command foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will remove the command foo, if present, from the list of TeX
commands.

   <p>The TeX filter mode is also available via <samp><span class="option">latex</span></samp> alias name.

<!-- The TeXfilter mode also contains a decoding and a encoding filter for -->
<!-- @emph{babel} character codes like the German Umlauts: -->
<!-- @itemize @bullet -->
<!-- @item -->
<!-- @code{@"a} -> @code{\"a} -> @code{"a} -->
<!-- @item -->
<!-- @code{@"o} -> @code{\"o} -> @code{"o} -->
<!-- @item -->
<!-- @code{@"u} -> @code{\"u} -> @code{"u} -->
<!-- @item -->
<!-- @code{@"s} -> @code{\"s} -> @code{"s} -->
<!-- @end itemize -->
<!-- @end quotation -->
<!-- @quotation -->
<!-- @option{add|rem-tex-multi-byte} conversion -->
<!-- Changes list of multi character coded TeX(babel) characters recognized -->
<!-- by Aspell.  In case of German umlauts mentioned above this would mean -->
<!-- that Aspell would decode from their multi character representation to -->
<!-- their proper single char representation.  Given the German word -->
<!-- @code{St@"arke} (strength) which within TeX/LaTeXdocument has to be -->
<!-- written as @code{St"arke} or as @code{St\"arke} would split it into -->
<!-- the two words @code{St} and @code{arke} if it does not know anything -->
<!-- about the multi character encoding @code{"a} or @code{\"a} of -->
<!-- @code{@"a}.  On the other hand if it knows about it than Aspell will -->
<!-- recognize the word properly and will not try to make any strange -->
<!-- suggestion. -->
<!-- Each multi character coding conversion has to be specified the -->
<!-- following way: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- @i{char}:@i{rep}[:@i{rep}[@dots{}]] -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- where @code{@i{char}} is the character encoded by multiple characters -->
<!-- and rep stands for a specific representation of that character.  For -->
<!-- each character may be specified as many representations as available -->
<!-- for it. -->
<!-- @end quotation -->
<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.7 Texinfo Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">texinfo</span></samp> filter allows you to spell check Texinfo files. 
It will skip over any Texinfo commands and their parameters when
appropriate.  It will also skip over some Texinfo environments such as
<samp><span class="command">example</span></samp>.  The list option <samp><span class="option">texinfo-ignore</span></samp>
controls which commands to ignore the parameters of and the list option
<samp><span class="option">texinfo-ignore-env</span></samp> controls which Texinfo
environments to ignore.

   <p>The Texinfo filter has special code to deal with the <samp><span class="command">@table</span></samp>
and related commands.  It will apply the formatting command to each of
the <samp><span class="command">@item</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">@itemx</span></samp> commands just like Texinfo
will.  This means that if the formatting command is <samp><span class="command">@code</span></samp>
and and the <samp><span class="command">@code</span></samp> command is a member of the
<samp><span class="option">texinfo-ignore</span></samp> option than the Texinfo filter will ignore the
parameter of the <samp><span class="command">@item</span></samp> command as if the parameter was also
the parameter of the <samp><span class="command">@code</span></samp> command.

   <p>The Texinfo filter will also skip over the `<samp><span class="samp">\input texinfo</span></samp>' line.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.8 Nroff Filter</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">nroff</span></samp> filter mode allows you to check the spelling of
Nroff documents. The mode is enabled by giving
<samp><span class="option">--add-filter=nroff</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp> command line option to
<samp><span class="command">aspell</span></samp>. It is also automatically enabled if the first three
characters of the file being checked are <code>.\"</code> (a <samp><span class="command">nroff</span></samp> comment
marker) or the file name ends in a one of the following suffixes:

     <ul>
<li>single decimal digit from `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to `<samp><span class="samp">9</span></samp>'
<li>letter `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>'
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">tmac</span></samp>'
</ul>

<p class="noindent">This filter mode skips following <samp><span class="command">nroff</span></samp> language
elements:

     <ul>
<li>Comments
<li>Requests
<li>Names of <samp><span class="command">nroff</span></samp> registers (both traditional two-letter
names and GNU nroff long names)
<li>Arguments to the following requests: <code>ds</code>, <code>de</code>, <code>nr</code>,
<code>do</code>, <code>so</code>. 
<li>Arguments to font switch (<code>\f</code>) and size switch (<code>\s</code>)
escapes
<li>Arguments to extended charset escape in both traditional
(<code>\(</code>) and extended (<code>\[comp1 comp2 ...]</code>) form. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.9 Context Filter</h5>

<p>The <em>context</em> filter allows Aspell to distinguish between visible
and invisible contexts.  The visible ones will be spell checked and
the invisible ones will be ignored.  The contexts are distinguished by
the fact that the visible/invisible ones are delimited by specific and
unique delimiter characters or character sequences.  Whether the
delimited contexts should be visible or invisible only stated by the
value of the <samp><span class="option">[dont-]context-visible-first</span></samp> option and not by
the delimiters.

   <p>The context delimiters are specified as pairs of delimiters via the
<samp><span class="option">add|rem-context-delimiters</span></samp> option.  The delimiters enclosing
a specific context are specified as a space separated pair.  If more
than one delimiter pair is specified by one call of
<samp><span class="option">add|rem-context-delimiters</span></samp> they have to be combined to a
comma separated list.  To indicate that a context is always closed by
end of line use <code>\0</code> sequence as closing delimiter.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.4.1.10 Ccpp Filter Mode</h5>

<p>The <samp><span class="option">ccpp</span></samp> filter mode will limit spell checking to C/C++ comments
and string literals. Any code in between will be left alone.
