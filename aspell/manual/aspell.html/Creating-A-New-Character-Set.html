This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h3 class="section">7.8 Creating A New Character Set</h3>

<p>If there is not a standard character set for your language then you
can invent one.  The new charset will only be used by Aspell
internally.  If the option <samp><span class="option">data-encoding</span></samp> is set to
`<samp><span class="samp">utf-8</span></samp>', and your current locale character type is always set to
`<samp><span class="samp">utf-8</span></samp>', then you can use UTF-8 for everything and not
worry yourself that an 8-bit character set is being used internally. 
If your language has no more than 210 distinct symbols, including
different capitalizations and accents, then Aspell can support it.

   <p>The first thing to do is to download the Aspell lang package
(see <a href="Creating-An-Official-Dictionary-Package.html#Creating-An-Official-Dictionary-Package">Creating An Official Dictionary Package</a>)
and check if one of the provided charsets in this package will suite
your needs.  Non-standard character sets are provided for many scripts
and languages.  If not, then see the included <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file for
instructions on creating a new one.  Version 0.1, and 0.2 of
mkchardata <em>will not</em> work as the format of the character data
file has changed.
