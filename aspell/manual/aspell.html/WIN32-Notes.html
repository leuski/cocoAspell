This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h3 class="appendixsec">E.8 WIN32 Notes</h3>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.1 Getting the WIN32 version</h4>

<p>The latest version of the native Aspell/WIN32 port, including
binaries, can be found at <a href="http://aspell.net/win32">http://aspell.net/win32</a>.  This page
has, unfortunately, not been updated for Aspell 0.60.  If you are
interested in updated the native port please let me know.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.2 Building the WIN32 version</h4>

<p>There are two basically different ways of building Aspell using GCC
for WIN32: You can either use the Cygwin compiler, which will produce
binaries that depend on the POSIX layer in <samp><span class="file">cygwin1.dll</span></samp>.  The
other way is using MinGW GCC, those binaries use the native C runtime
from Microsoft (MSVCRT.DLL).

<!-- FIXME: Is the following true? -->
<!-- If you intend to use or link against the -->
<!-- Aspell libraries using a native WIN32 compiler (e.g.  MS Visual C++), -->
<!-- you will need the MinGW built ones to avoid problems caused by the -->
<!-- different runtime libraries. -->
<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">E.8.2.1 Building Aspell using Cygwin</h5>

<p>This works exactly like on other POSIX
compatible systems using the `<samp><span class="samp">./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</span></samp>'
cycle.  Some versions of Cygwin GCC will fail to link, this is caused
by an incorrect <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.la</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="file">/lib</span></samp> directory. 
After removing or renaming this file, the build progress should work
(GCC-2.95 and GCC-3.x should work).

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">E.8.2.2 Building Aspell using MinGW</h5>

<p>There are several different ways to build Aspell using MinGW.  The
easiest way is to use a Cygwin compiler but instruct it to build a
native binary rather than a Cygwin one.  To do this configure with:

<pre class="example">     ./configure CFLAGS='-O2 -mno-cygwin' CXXFLAGS='-O2 -mno-cygwin'
</pre>
   <p>You may also want to add the option
<samp><span class="option">--enable-win32-relocatable</span></samp> to use more windows friendly
directories.  See <a href="Win32_002dDirectories.html#Win32_002dDirectories">Win32-Directories</a>.  In this case configure with:

<pre class="smallexample">     ./configure CFLAGS='-O2 -mno-cygwin' CXXFLAGS='-O2 -mno-cygwin' --enable-win32-relocatable
</pre>
   <p>It should also be possible to build Aspell using the MSYS environment. 
But this has not been very well tested.  If building with MSYS
<em>do not</em> add `<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS ...</span></samp>' to configure.

<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">E.8.2.3 Building Aspell without using Cygwin or MSYS</h5>

<p>It is also possible to build Aspell without Cygwin of MinGW by using
the files in the <samp><span class="file">win32/</span></samp> subdirectory.  However, these files
have not been updated to work with Aspell 0.60.  Thus the following
instructions will not work without some effort.  If you do get Aspell
to compile this way please send me the updated files so that I can
include them with the next release.

   <p>To compile Aspell with the MinGW
compiler, you will need at least GCC-3.2 (as shipped with MinGW-2.0.3)
and some GNU tools like <samp><span class="command">rm</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">cp</span></samp>.  The origin of
those tools doesn't matter, it has shown to work with any tools from
MinGW/MSys, Cygwin or Linux.  To build Aspell, move into the
<samp><span class="file">win32</span></samp> subdirectory and type `<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>'.  You can enable some
additional build options by either commenting out the definitions at
the head of the Makefile or passing those values as environment
variables or at the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> command line.  Following options
are supported:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">DEBUGVERSION</span></samp><dd>If set to "1", the binaries will include debugging information
(resulting in a much bigger size).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">CURSESDIR</span></samp><dd>Enter the path to the pdcurses library here, in order to get a nicer
console interface (see below).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">MSVCLIB</span></samp><dd>Enter the filename of MS <samp><span class="file">lib.exe</span></samp> here, if you want to build
libraries that can be imported from MS Visual C++.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">WIN32_RELOCATABLE</span></samp><dd>If set to "1", Aspell will detect the prefix from the path where the
DLL resides (see below for further details).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">TARGET</span></samp><dd>Sets a prefix to be used for cross compilation (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-</span></samp> to cross compile from Linux). 
</dl>

   <p>There are also a MinGW compilers available for Cygwin and Linux, both
versions are able to compile Aspell using the prebuilt
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.  While the Cygwin port automatically detects the
correct compiler, the Linux version depends on setting the
<samp><span class="env">TARGET</span></samp> variable in the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> (or environment) to the
correct compiler prefix.

   <p>Other compilers may work.  There is a patch for MS Visual C++ 6.0
available at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell</a>, but it needs a lot
of changes to the Aspell sources.  It has also been reported that the
Intel C++ compiler can be used for compilation.

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.3 (PD)Curses</h4>

<p>In order to get the nice full screen interface when spell checking
files, a curses implementation that does not require Cygwin is
required.  The PDCurses (<a href="http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net">http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net</a>)
implementation is known to work, other implementations may work
however they have not been tested.  See the previous section for
information on specifying the location of the curses library and
include file.

   <p>Curses notes:

     <ul>
<li>PDcurses built with MinGW needs to be compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-DPDC_STATIC_BUILD</span></samp> to avoid duplicate declaration of
<samp><span class="file">DllMain</span></samp> when compiling <samp><span class="file">aspell.exe</span></samp>.

     <li>The curses enabled version can cause trouble in some shells (MSys
<samp><span class="command">rxvt</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp>) and will produce errors like
`<samp><span class="samp">initscr() LINES=1 COLS=1: too small</span></samp>'.  Use a non-curses version
for those purposes. 
</ul>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.4 Directories</h4>

<p>If Aspell is configured with <samp><span class="option">--enable-win32-relocatable</span></samp> or
compiled with <samp><span class="option">WIN32_RELOCATABLE=1</span></samp> when using a Makefile, it
can be run from any directory: it will set <samp><var>prefix</var></samp>
according to its install location (assuming it resides in
<samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">\\bin</span></samp>).  Your personal wordlists will be saved in
the <samp><var>prefix</var></samp> directory with their names changed from
<samp><span class="file">.aspell.</span><var>lang</var><span class="file">.*</span></samp> to <samp><var>lang</var><span class="file">.*</span></samp> (you can override
the path by setting the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> environment variable).

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.5 Installer</h4>

<p>The installer registers the DLLs as shared libraries, you should
increase the reference counter to avoid the libraries being
uninstalled if your application still depends on them (and decrease it
again when uninstalling your program).  The reference counters are
located under:
<pre class="example">     HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDLLs
</pre>
   <p>The install location and version numbers are stored under

<pre class="example">     HKLM\SOFTWARE\Aspell
</pre>
   <h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.8.6 WIN32 consoles</h4>

<p>The console uses a different encoding than GUI applications, changing
this to to a Windows encoding (e.g.  1252) is not supported on
Win9x/Me.  On WinNT (and later) those codepages can be set by first
changing the console font to `<samp><span class="samp">lucida console</span></samp>', then changing the
codepage using `<samp><span class="samp">chcp 1252</span></samp>'.

   <p>Some alternative shells (e.g. MSys' <samp><span class="command">rxvt</span></samp> or Cygwin's
<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>) do a codepage conversion (if correctly set up), so
running Aspell inside those shells might be a workaround for Win9x.
